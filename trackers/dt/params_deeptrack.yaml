# * Each node has a list of metadata:
# - pretty name (displayed). Note, the node name/identifier itself is also meaningful as the fieldname in the data struct.
# - type (see PropertiesGUIProp.m for options)
# - isEditable
# - description
# - default value
# - optional char, M-filename of ParameterVisualization concrete subclass 
# * After the metadata comes a list of child nodes.
# * As a shortcut, leaf nodes can contain the metadata directly as their value.
