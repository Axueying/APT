APT:  Predicts the location of body parts based on part labels from a set of video frames. 
 
<p> APT takes video files as inputs (with optional tracking files), and the user interactively trains a body part classifier by labeling a user-specified number of body part locations. </p>



APT is being developed by Kristin Branson, Mayank Kabra, Allen Lee, Alice Robie, and Felipe Rodriguez.  All work is funded by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the Janelia Research Campus.
